Website for Sociotechnical Imaginaries of Responsible AI Engineering for Gender Equity project workshops

## Aims
This project aims to understand diverse narratives that shape collective visions of future responsible AI for gender equity and to inform research, practice and policy agendas to engineer RAI to bring that desired future. We also aim to build a community and a safe space to inspire future events, collaborations, and critical reflection of the past and present of RAI.

To achieve the aims, we will explore the following research questions:
 * RQ1: What are the sociotechnical imaginaries of responsible AI technologies free of gender-based violence? 
* RQ2: Where do imaginaries about the future of responsible AI come from? How do competing imaginaries co-exist or conflict? Why do certain visions of the future become powerful? And how will future RAI navigate existing power structures?
* RQ3: What does being responsible look like in design, development, deployment, marketing and regulation processes? What are symbols, narratives, and representations of AI being engineered to ‘be responsible’?
* RQ4: What are the differences in sociotechnical imaginaries of RAI in the UK and Ireland? What factors underpin such differences?
